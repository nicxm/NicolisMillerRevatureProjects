/*
 * fixtures.Room:
This class represents a room in the house. It will extend fixtures.Fixture, and so will inherit the descriptive properties. The Room will also have the following properties:

Room[] exits : the rooms adjacent to this one. You might decide that a room in a particular direction always uses a certain index, e.g. a north exit always goes in index 0, an east exit always goes in index 1, etc. If so, then the size of this array depends on how many directions you want to support.
